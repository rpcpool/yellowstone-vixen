# Shipstern Sources

## Overview

Shipstern introduces a flexible `Source` system that allows you to connect to various data sources and stream their updates through a standardized interface. This feature is designed to be extensible, allowing you to create custom sources while maintaining a consistent API.

## Key Features

- 🔌 **Standardized Connection Interface**: Connect to any data source using a unified API
- 📡 **Asynchronous Updates**: Stream data updates through channels
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Set up filters and source-specific configurations
- 🔄 **Extensible**: Create your own custom sources

## How It Works

The [`Source`](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/blob/main/crates/runtime/src/sources.rs) trait provides a standardized way to:
- Connect to external data sources
- Stream updates through a channel to the Shipstern runtime for processing
- Configure filters for data processing
- Manage source-specific configuration

## Runtime filter updates

The gRPC source keeps the `SubscribeRequest` sink that `yellowstone-grpc-client`
returns next to the update stream, so a caller can change the subscription
without tearing down the connection and losing messages during the reconnect.

Take a `RuntimeHandle` before running, because `run` and `run_async` both
consume the runtime, then edit the live set through it from wherever the
change originates. Handles are cheap to clone and share one view of the
filters. Nothing on the handle awaits, so it works the same from async code
and from a plain thread beside a blocking `run()`:

```rust
let runtime = Runtime::<YellowstoneGrpcSource>::builder()
    .account(Pipeline::new(TokenProgramAccParser, [Handler]))
    .try_build(config)?;

let handle = runtime.handle();
tokio::spawn(runtime.run_async());

// Widen the account subscription with one more owner.
let extra = Prefilter::builder().account_owners([new_mint]).build()?;
handle.update_filters(|filters| filters.merge(TokenProgramAccParser.id(), extra))?;

// Inspect what is live, replace it wholesale, or go back to the start.
let current = handle.filters();
handle.send_filter_update(current)?;
handle.reset_filters()?;
```

`Filters` offers `get`, `insert`, `merge` and `remove` keyed by parser ID for
building the next set.

Each `Filters` sent replaces the whole subscription rather than adding to it,
which is what the server does with a mid-stream request, so send the complete
set every time.

The map keys are parser IDs, and a set naming a parser with no registered
pipeline is refused with `FilterUpdateError::UnknownParser` before anything is
sent, since the server would stream data the runtime then discards. Take the
keys from `Parser::id()`. Only the newest set matters: two updates in quick
succession may reach the source as the second alone, and a set rejected while
the source is between connections is retried once the stream recovers, but the
sender is not told either way.

The server applies the new set promptly, but you see it only once whatever is
already queued drains, so the delay is however far behind your pipeline already
was rather than a property of the update. Against a live endpoint, a consumer
running about 15 seconds behind kept receiving the old set for roughly that
long, and the first updates matching the new set arrived stale by the same
margin before catching up. A pipeline keeping pace sees the change almost at
once. A returned `send` means the request was handed off, not that the
subscription has changed.

A set the server refuses, by exceeding its configured filter limits for
example, comes back on the stream with a code the client does not retry, which
ends the run. An update the provider will not accept stops the runtime rather
than leaving the previous subscription in place, so validate against the
provider's limits before sending one.

`send_filter_update` fails with `FilterUpdateError::Unsupported` for sources
that do not implement this, which today is every source except gRPC, and with
`FilterUpdateError::Closed` once the runtime has stopped. Whether an update takes effect
also depends on the provider. Both `yellowstone-grpc-geyser` and `richat` apply
mid-stream requests to a live subscription, but a deployment can sit behind
infrastructure that does not forward them.

## Creating a Custom Source

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating your own source:

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender;
use shipstern::sources::Source;
use shipstern::config::YellowstoneConfig;
use shipstern_core::Filters;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyCustomSource {
    filters: Option<Filters>,
    config: Option<YellowstoneConfig>,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Source for MyCustomSource {
    async fn connect(
        &self,
        tx: Sender<Result<SubscribeUpdate, Status>>,
    ) -> Result<JoinSet<()>, crate::Error> {
        // Your connection logic here
        todo!()
    }

    fn name(&self) -> String {
        "my-custom-source".to_string()
    }

    // ... other required methods
}
```

## Required Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `connect` | Establishes connection to the data source and streams updates |
| `name` | Returns a unique identifier for the source |
| `set_filters_unchecked` | Sets filters for data processing |
| `set_config_unchecked` | Sets source-specific configuration |
| `get_filters` | Retrieves current filters |
| `get_config` | Retrieves current configuration |

## Optional Methods

The trait provides two optional methods with safe default implementations:

- `filters`: Safely sets filters if none are currently set
- `config`: Safely sets configuration if none is currently set

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: Choose clear, descriptive names for your sources
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your `connect` method
3. **Resource Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of resources when the source is dropped
4. **Configuration**: Use the configuration system to make your source flexible
5. **Filtering**: Implement efficient filtering to reduce unnecessary data transfer

## Example Use Case

Here's a practical example of how to use a source:

```rust
shipstern::Runtime::builder()
    // Add the source to the runtime
    .source(YellowstoneGrpcSource::new())
    // We could call this multiple times to add concurrent Sources
    // .source(SolanaAccountsRpcSource::new())
    .account(Pipeline::new(TokenProgramAccParser, [Handler]))
    .account(Pipeline::new(TokenExtensionProgramAccParser, [Handler]))
    .instruction(Pipeline::new(TokenExtensionProgramIxParser, [Handler]))
    .instruction(Pipeline::new(TokenProgramIxParser, [Handler]))
    .build(config)
    .run();
```

## 🔮 Roadmap

### 📅 Planned Features
