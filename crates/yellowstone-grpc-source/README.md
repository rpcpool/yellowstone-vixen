# Shipstern Sources

## Overview

Shipstern introduces a flexible `Source` system that allows you to connect to various data sources and stream their updates through a standardized interface. This feature is designed to be extensible, allowing you to create custom sources while maintaining a consistent API.

## Key Features

- 🔌 **Standardized Connection Interface**: Connect to any data source using a unified API
- 📡 **Asynchronous Updates**: Stream data updates through channels
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Set up filters and source-specific configurations
- 🔄 **Extensible**: Create your own custom sources

## How It Works

The [`Source`](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/blob/main/crates/runtime/src/sources.rs) trait provides a standardized way to:
- Connect to external data sources
- Stream updates through a channel to the Shipstern runtime for processing
- Configure filters for data processing
- Manage source-specific configuration

## Runtime filter updates

The gRPC source keeps the `SubscribeRequest` sink that `yellowstone-grpc-client`
returns next to the update stream, so a caller can change the subscription
without tearing down the connection and losing messages during the reconnect.

Take a `RuntimeHandle` before running, because `run` and `run_async` both
consume the runtime, then edit the live set through it from wherever the
change originates. Handles are cheap to clone and share one view of the
filters. Nothing on the handle awaits, so it works the same from async code
and from a plain thread beside a blocking `run()`:

```rust
let runtime = Runtime::<YellowstoneGrpcSource>::builder()
    .account(Pipeline::new(TokenProgramAccParser, [Handler]))
    .try_build(config)?;

let handle = runtime.handle();
tokio::spawn(runtime.run_async());

// Widen the account subscription with one more owner.
let extra = Prefilter::builder().account_owners([new_mint]).build()?;
handle.update_filters(|filters| filters.merge(TokenProgramAccParser.id(), extra))?;

// Inspect what is live, replace it wholesale, or go back to the start.
let current = handle.filters();
handle.send_filter_update(current)?;
handle.reset_filters()?;
```

`Filters` offers `get`, `insert`, `merge` and `remove` keyed by parser ID for
building the next set.

Each `Filters` sent replaces the whole subscription rather than adding to it,
which is what the server does with a mid-stream request, so send the complete
set every time.

The map keys are parser IDs, and a set naming a parser with no registered
pipeline is refused with `FilterUpdateError::UnknownParser` before anything is
sent, since the server would stream data the runtime then discards. Take the
keys from `Parser::id()`. Only the newest set matters: two updates in quick
succession may reach the source as the second alone, and a set rejected while
the source is between connections is retried once the stream recovers, but the
sender is not told either way.

The server applies the new set promptly, but you see it only once whatever is
already queued drains, so the delay is however far behind your pipeline already
was rather than a property of the update. Against a live endpoint, a consumer
running about 15 seconds behind kept receiving the old set for roughly that
long, and the first updates matching the new set arrived stale by the same
margin before catching up. A pipeline keeping pace sees the change almost at
once. A returned `send` means the request was handed off, not that the
subscription has changed.

A set the server refuses, by exceeding its configured filter limits for
example, comes back on the stream with a code the client does not retry, which
ends the run. An update the provider will not accept stops the runtime rather
than leaving the previous subscription in place, so validate against the
provider's limits before sending one.

`Runtime::handle` exists only for sources implementing `FilterUpdateSource`,
which today is gRPC alone, so a runtime on any other source has no handle to
take and the mistake is a compile error. An update fails with
`FilterUpdateError::Closed` once the runtime has stopped. Whether an update takes effect
also depends on the provider. Both `yellowstone-grpc-geyser` and `richat` apply
mid-stream requests to a live subscription, but a deployment can sit behind
infrastructure that does not forward them.

## Creating a Custom Source

A source is a value the runtime is handed. Implement `SourceTrait` with one
method, `connect`, which receives the filter set derived from the registered
pipelines and streams updates until the stream ends:

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use shipstern::sources::{SourceExitStatus, SourceTrait};
use shipstern_core::Filters;
use tokio::sync::{mpsc::Sender, oneshot};
use yellowstone_grpc_proto::{geyser::SubscribeUpdate, tonic::Status};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct MySource {
    endpoint: String,
}

#[async_trait]
impl SourceTrait for MySource {
    async fn connect(
        &self,
        filters: Filters,
        tx: Sender<Result<SubscribeUpdate, Status>>,
        status_tx: oneshot::Sender<SourceExitStatus>,
    ) -> Result<(), shipstern::Error> {
        // Open the stream for `filters` and forward each update into `tx`.
        // When it ends, say how, then return.
        let _ = status_tx.send(SourceExitStatus::Completed);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Hand an instance to the builder with `try_build_with`:

```rust
Runtime::builder()
    .account(Pipeline::new(TokenProgramAccParser, [Handler]))
    .try_build_with(MySource { endpoint }, buffer_config)?
    .run_async()
    .await;
```

### Building from a config document

Implement `FromConfig` as well and the runtime can construct the source from
its section of a `ShipsternConfig`, which is what `try_build` does. This is
how every source in this repository is wired up so a TOML file or CLI flags
can select it:

```rust
use shipstern::sources::FromConfig;

impl FromConfig for MySource {
    type Config = MyConfig;

    fn from_config(config: Self::Config) -> Self { Self { endpoint: config.endpoint } }
}

let config: ShipsternConfig<MyConfig> = toml::from_str(&text)?;

Runtime::<MySource>::builder()
    .account(Pipeline::new(TokenProgramAccParser, [Handler]))
    .try_build(config)?
    .run();
```

### Applying filter updates

Implement `FilterUpdateSource` and override `connect_with_filter_updates` to
apply each set published on the receiver to the live subscription, as the
gRPC source does. That is what makes `Runtime::handle` available to callers.
Sources that cannot change a subscription mid-stream leave both alone.

### Best Practices

1. **Exit status**: Always send a `SourceExitStatus` before returning so the runtime can tell a clean end from a failure.
2. **Backpressure**: `tx.send(..).await` fails once the runtime has stopped. Treat that as a signal to return with `ReceiverDropped`, not as an error.
3. **Filters**: Translate the whole `Filters` set into the narrowest subscription the provider supports, so the runtime discards as little as possible.
4. **State**: Anything the source needs beyond its config, a shared client for instance, can live on the struct since the caller constructs it.
