# Generate a Shipstern Parser from a Codama IDL

Shipstern generates a parser from a [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) IDL at
compile time, through the `include_shipstern_parser!` proc macro. Nothing is written to
disk and no build script is involved.

```
Codama JSON ──> include_shipstern_parser! ──> generated parser
  (complete)        (compile time)       (accounts, instructions, events)
```

## Quick start

**1. Convert your IDL to Codama JSON.** The macro reads Codama nodes, not a raw Anchor IDL.

One wrinkle makes this more than a one-liner. The macro deserialises through `codama-nodes`
(pinned to `=0.9.1`), whose serde requires most node fields to be present rather than
defaulting them, while Codama's JavaScript tooling omits empty and default-valued fields.
Feeding `JSON.stringify(rootNodeFromAnchor(idl))` straight to the macro fails with
`missing field 'additionalPrograms'` or `missing field 'accounts'`, depending on which
collection happens to be empty. Codama also freezes its nodes, so the tree has to be cloned
before those fields can be added.

```javascript
// convert.cjs
const fs = require("node:fs");
const path = require("node:path");
const { rootNodeFromAnchor } = require("@codama/nodes-from-anchor");

const DEFAULTS = {
    rootNode: { additionalPrograms: [] },
    programNode: { accounts: [], definedTypes: [], errors: [], pdas: [], docs: [] },
    instructionNode: {
        accounts: [], arguments: [], discriminators: [],
        docs: [], subInstructions: [], remainingAccounts: [],
    },
    accountNode: { discriminators: [], docs: [] },
    eventNode: { discriminators: [], docs: [] },
    definedTypeNode: { docs: [] },
    structFieldTypeNode: { docs: [] },
    instructionArgumentNode: { docs: [] },
    instructionAccountNode: { docs: [] },
    errorNode: { docs: [] },
};

function backfill(node) {
    if (Array.isArray(node)) return node.forEach(backfill);
    if (!node || typeof node !== "object") return;

    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(DEFAULTS[node.kind] ?? {})) {
        if (!(key in node)) node[key] = value;
    }

    Object.values(node).forEach(backfill);
}

const idl = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, "idl.json"), "utf8"));

// Codama freezes its nodes, so round-trip through JSON for a mutable tree.
const tree = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(rootNodeFromAnchor(idl)));
backfill(tree);

fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, "codama.json"), JSON.stringify(tree, null, 2));
```

```bash
pnpm install @codama/nodes-from-anchor
node convert.cjs
```

If your IDL is already in complete Codama form, skip this step. `tests/idls/*.json` in this
repository are all in that shape and make a useful reference.

If your IDL is already in complete Codama form, continue to step 2.

**2. Add the dependencies.**

```toml
[dependencies]
borsh = { version = "^1.0.0", features = ["derive"] }
shipstern-core = { version = "0.10.0" }
shipstern-parser = { version = "0.10.0" }
shipstern-proc-macro = { version = "0.10.0" }
```

`shipstern-core` and the Borsh `derive` feature are both required: the generated code
imports `shipstern_core` and derives `BorshDeserialize` / `BorshSerialize` on every type.

To parse events, including self-CPI events, add the `program-events` feature:

```toml
shipstern-proc-macro = { version = "0.10.0", features = ["program-events"] }
```

**3. Invoke the macro.** The path is resolved relative to your crate root
(`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`).

```rust
use shipstern_proc_macro::include_shipstern_parser;

include_shipstern_parser!("path/to/codama.json");
```

**4. Use the generated module.** It is named after the program, in snake_case, and
contains `PROGRAM_ID`, `InstructionParser`, `AccountParser`, and the argument and account
types.

```rust
let parsed = my_program::InstructionParser.parse(&update).await?;
```

## What Shipstern reads from the IDL

The macro consumes a subset of the Codama tree. Anything not listed here is ignored, so
changing it will not affect the generated parser.

| Codama node | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `program.name` | the generated module name, in snake_case |
| `program.publicKey` | `PROGRAM_ID` |
| `program.instructions[].discriminators` | the instruction dispatch key |
| `program.instructions[].arguments` | the `*Args` struct |
| `program.instructions[].accounts` | the `*Accounts` struct |
| `program.accounts[]` | account types and `AccountParser` |
| `program.definedTypes[]` | shared types, referenced through `definedTypeLinkNode` |
| `events[]` | event types, **only** with the `program-events` feature |

Ignored: `pdas` and `docs` are not read at all. `errors` is only normalised on load, where a
string `"code": "6000"` is coerced to a number; it is never rendered into the parser.

### Discriminators

Instructions and accounts do not accept the same discriminator kinds.

| Declared on | `constantDiscriminatorNode` | `fieldDiscriminatorNode` | `sizeDiscriminatorNode` |
|---|---|---|---|
| instruction | yes, bytes or number value | yes | yes, for dispatch only |
| account | yes | yes | yes |
| event | yes, and a chain of two or more declares the CPI envelope | no | no |

A size-discriminated instruction routes on data length like any other, but carries no
discriminator bytes, so no `*_DISCRIMINATOR` constant is emitted for it. When *every*
instruction in a program is size-discriminated the whole `impl Instructions` block is
skipped, and referencing a `*_DISCRIMINATOR` on it will not compile. See
`tests/proc-macro/tests/size_only_instructions.rs`.

Where several instructions share a discriminator, the generated parser disambiguates by
account count, trying the variant with the most accounts first. When variants share both
the discriminator and the account count, supply a `CustomInstructionParser`; see the
[README](../README.md#handling-discriminator-collisions).

## The `program-events` feature

Event parsing is feature-gated. Without `program-events`, the macro emits no event types
and no self-CPI handling at all, however the IDL declares its events.

Enabling it also **changes the parser's output type**: `InstructionParser::Output` becomes
`ProgramEventOutput`, which carries the decoded instruction alongside any events found on
the transaction's inner instructions, instead of `Instructions` alone.

```rust
// with program-events
ProgramEventOutput {
    instruction: Some(Instructions { .. }),
    program_events: [Events { .. }],
}
```

Because this changes a public type, enabling the feature anywhere in a workspace affects
every crate that shares the dependency through Cargo's feature unification. Keep crates
that need different settings in separate workspaces.

## Self-CPI events (`emit_cpi!`)

`emit_cpi!` does not write a log line. It invokes the program from itself, with
instruction data shaped as:

```
[envelope tag][event discriminator][borsh payload]
```

Codama has no node for that tag, so Shipstern infers it positionally from the
event's discriminator chain, the same rule the Carbon renderer uses. Declare two
or more `constantDiscriminatorNode`s on the event:

```json
"discriminators": [
  { "kind": "constantDiscriminatorNode", "offset": 0,
    "constant": { "kind": "constantValueNode",
      "type": { "kind": "fixedSizeTypeNode", "size": 8, "type": { "kind": "bytesTypeNode" } },
      "value": { "kind": "bytesValueNode", "data": "e445a52e51cb9a1d", "encoding": "base16" } } },
  { "kind": "constantDiscriminatorNode", "offset": 8,
    "constant": { "kind": "constantValueNode",
      "type": { "kind": "fixedSizeTypeNode", "size": 8, "type": { "kind": "bytesTypeNode" } },
      "value": { "kind": "bytesValueNode", "data": "40c6cde8260871e2", "encoding": "base16" } } }
]
```

The rules:

- The constant at **offset 0** is the envelope tag.
- Every remaining constant forms the event's own discriminator.
- `payload_offset` is `sorted[1].offset`, the declared offset of the next
  discriminator, not the tag's length. Padded layouts therefore round-trip, and
  discriminators need not be contiguous.
- One program has one envelope. Events that declare one must agree on both the
  tag bytes and the payload offset, or the build fails.
- An event with a single discriminator declares no envelope. It keeps matching
  at offset 0 and stays reachable from `emit!` log lines.
- When no event declares an envelope and no macro argument supplies one, Anchor's
  default 8-byte tag is used.

`e445a52e51cb9a1d` is the little-endian serialisation of
`sha256("anchor:event")[..8]`, whose natural byte order is `1d9acb512ea545e4`.
Write the wire bytes, not the digest prefix.

### Setting the envelope through Codama

The discriminator chain is the whole configuration surface. A padded envelope, taken from
`tests/idls/padded_cpi_event_envelope.json`, declares a one-byte tag at offset 0 and the
event's own two-byte discriminator at offset 4:

```json
"discriminators": [
  { "kind": "constantDiscriminatorNode", "offset": 0,
    "constant": { "kind": "constantValueNode",
      "type": { "kind": "fixedSizeTypeNode", "size": 1, "type": { "kind": "bytesTypeNode" } },
      "value": { "kind": "bytesValueNode", "data": "fe", "encoding": "base16" } } },
  { "kind": "constantDiscriminatorNode", "offset": 4,
    "constant": { "kind": "constantValueNode",
      "type": { "kind": "fixedSizeTypeNode", "size": 2, "type": { "kind": "bytesTypeNode" } },
      "value": { "kind": "bytesValueNode", "data": "a1a2", "encoding": "base16" } } }
]
```

That gives a `payload_offset` of 4, so the wire layout is:

```
offset   0    1              4        6
        | fe | 00 00 00     | a1 a2 | borsh payload |
        | tag| three pad    | disc  |               |
```

`tests/proc-macro-events/tests/padded_cpi_event_envelope.rs` covers both directions: the
CPI path strips the declared offset of 4 rather than a fixed 8, and the log path still
matches the same event once its discriminators are rebased.

### The envelope must not mask an instruction

The generated parser filters any instruction whose data starts with the envelope
tag before it dispatches, so an instruction whose discriminator shares a prefix
with the tag at offset 0 could never be parsed. That is rejected at build time:

    error: Invalid CPI event envelope in "...": CPI event envelope 09 collides
    with instruction `swapBig` (discriminator 09 at offset 0); the generated
    parser filters every instruction whose data starts with the envelope tag, so
    `swapBig` would never parse

The check runs against the tag the parser actually uses, so it covers an IDL
envelope, the `cpi_event_discriminator` fallback, and the Anchor default alike.
It compares the tag only against instructions. Instruction variants that
deliberately share a discriminator with each other, resolved at runtime by
account count or a `CustomInstructionParser`, are unaffected.

Note this differs from Anchor, whose dispatcher checks the event-CPI sentinel
after every instruction rather than before.

### Deliberate divergences from Carbon

Both follow from Shipstern supporting `emit!` log events, which Carbon's
generated decoders do not.

1. **Mixed programs are accepted.** Carbon bails on the whole program if any
   single event lacks the two-discriminator form; Shipstern accepts a program
   that mixes `emit_cpi!` and `emit!` events. An IDL Shipstern accepts may
   therefore render nothing in Carbon.
2. **A lone two-part discriminator reads as enveloped.** The heuristic is
   positional and no marker node exists, so an event with a genuine two-part
   discriminator starting at offset 0 is indistinguishable from
   envelope-plus-discriminator, and is treated as the latter.

### Legacy macro arguments

`cpi_event_discriminator` and `cpi_event_payload_offset` on
`include_shipstern_parser!` remain a fallback for IDLs that declare no envelope:

```rust
include_shipstern_parser!(
    "path/to/codama.json",
    cpi_event_discriminator = 0xfe,
    cpi_event_payload_offset = 1,
);
```

Precedence is:

1. an envelope declared in the IDL, which wins whenever present
2. these arguments, which apply only when the IDL declares none
3. Anchor's default 8-byte tag, when neither is supplied

When the IDL declares an envelope the arguments are ignored and a deprecation warning
fires at the call site. No removal version is currently established. Prefer declaring the
envelope in the IDL, which is the supported path.

## Generating a standalone parser crate

There is also a Codama renderer that writes a complete parser crate to disk, rather than
expanding a macro in your own crate. It is a separate tool with its own workflow.

> **Note:** the renderer has not been republished under the Shipstern name. The package
> `@codama/renderers-shipstern-parser` referenced by earlier versions of this guide does
> not exist on npm. The last published release is `@codama/renderers-vixen-parser` 1.2.8
> (October 2025). Running it against a small Anchor IDL on the current toolchain emitted
> only the `generated_sdk/` half and exited non-zero, without producing the
> `generated_parser/` or `proto/` output this workflow depends on. Whether that is
> specific to that IDL was not investigated further. Use the proc macro above.
