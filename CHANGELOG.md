## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `shipstern.parse` and `shipstern.handle` are now `debug` spans instead of `info`, so they no longer spam `info`-level trace output ([#313](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/313) by @ultrasilicon).
- Bumped the Solana/Agave dependency stack from `3.x` to `4.2.2`. This is the half of Transaction V1 (SIMD-0385) support that lives in the dependency graph: `VersionedMessage::V1` first appears in `solana-message` 4.0.0, so a 3.x build cannot represent a v1 message at all. [#304](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/304) already surfaced the inline budget as `InstructionShared::transaction_config`. Raises MSRV from 1.90 to 1.93, which Agave 4.2.2 requires (`iter::chain` in const contexts at 1.91, `MaybeUninit::write_copy_of_slice` at 1.93); see [#209](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/issues/209). `enable_tx_v1` is activated on devnet and testnet. On mainnet-beta the feature account is funded but still owned by the System program with no data, so it is staged rather than queued. Devnet is already carrying v1 traffic.
- Bumped `spl-token-2022` from 10 to 11, forced by Agave 4.2.2's `spl-token-group-interface ^0.7.2`. Brings the `PermissionedBurn` extension and its authority type, added to the proto `AuthorityType` enum as value 17, and replaces `OptionalNonZeroPubkey` with `MaybeNull<Address>`. `NativeExtensionData` still rejects `PermissionedBurn`, because there is no proto message for `PermissionedBurnConfig` yet.
- **Wire-visible behaviour change**: `UpdateGroupAuthority.new_authority` now reports `None` where it previously emitted the all-zero sentinel pubkey as a real key. It was built as an unconditional `Some(..)`; `MaybeNull::get()` maps the sentinel to `None` (`Address::NONE` is `[0u8; 32]`, so null and the zero key are the same value, exactly as in the deleted `opt_nonzero_pubkey_to_bytes` helper). `InitializeGroup.update_authority` is unchanged, because it already went through that helper. This is a fix, but consumers reading `new_authority` will see a changed value.
- `shipstern-solana-snapshot-source`: `bank_forks_utils::load_bank_forks` was replaced upstream by `try_load_bank_forks_from_snapshot`, which takes no blockstore and returns `Option`. Two consequences beyond the signature. The source no longer opens the blockstore at `AccessType::PrimaryForMaintenance`, so it no longer takes an exclusive RocksDB lock on the ledger directory, and it now fails with a clear error when the snapshot archives directory holds nothing loadable. Account scanning moved from the now-private `AccountsDb::scan_accounts` to `Bank::scan_all_accounts`; accounts-db 4.x deleted `ScanOrder` entirely (`ScanConfig` is `pub(crate)` and carries only an abort flag), so startup account updates are no longer emitted in pubkey-sorted order. Nothing in shipstern relied on that order.
- `shipstern-solana-rpc-source`: `solana-client` 4.x replaced `get_program_accounts_with_config` with `get_program_ui_accounts_with_config`, which returns RPC-encoded `UiAccount`s. The owner is now parsed from a base58 string and the data decoded, so a malformed owner or an undecodable payload fails the source where previously neither could happen.
- `shipstern-bpf-loader-parser`: `solana-loader-v3-interface` 7 dropped the `Migrate` and `ExtendProgramChecked` variants, so the instruction match is exhaustive and an unknown discriminant now fails earlier, in `UpgradeableLoaderInstruction::try_from_slice`.
- Bumped `yellowstone-grpc-proto` from `12.4` to `12.6`, picking up the Transaction V1 (SIMD-0385) `Message.config` field and the `cuckoo_account_include` transaction filter. The new filter is not exposed through `TransactionFilter` and is always sent as `None` ([#304](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/304) by @ultrasilicon).

### Added

- `shipstern-core`: `InstructionShared` gained `transaction_config: Option<TransactionConfig>`, the inline compute budget that Transaction V1 (SIMD-0385) carries on the message instead of in top-level `ComputeBudget` instructions. It exposes the priority fee, compute-unit limit, loaded-accounts data-size limit, and heap size. It is `None` for Legacy and V0 transactions and for jetstream-source transactions, which are decoded from an SDK without a V1 message variant ([#304](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/304) by @ultrasilicon).
- `shipstern-proc-macro`: generated account types and the `Instructions` wrapper now expose `DISCRIMINATOR` and `DISCRIMINATOR_OFFSET` constants, so consumers can build `memcmp` filters and route on discriminators without re-deriving the bytes from the IDL. The pair is a memcmp predicate: the bytes the parser compares at that offset. It is not a payload boundary, because numeric discriminators (for example SPL Governance) are re-read as the first field of the account body, so decoding still goes through `try_unpack`. No constant is emitted where the parser could not honor it: size-only discriminators, zero-length discriminators, fixed-size fields whose declared width disagrees with the decoded default bytes, and instruction names that collide after case folding ([#294](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-vixen/issues/294)).

### Fixed

- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: populate `Reward::commission_bps` on both reward conversion paths. The field arrived with `yellowstone-grpc-proto` 12.5 and was hardcoded to an empty string, so consumers reading it saw nothing even though `commission` was already forwarded. `solana_transaction_status::Reward` keeps both fields, so that path forwards `commission_bps` directly. `solana_runtime::reward_info::RewardInfo` dropped the percent in 4.2 and keeps only `commission_bps`, so that path derives the percent as `bps / 100` instead. That is lossless against every current mainnet vote account, since SIMD-0185 constrains stored commissions to multiples of 100 bps, and becomes lossy only once SIMD-0291 activates. Salvaged from ([#254](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-vixen/pull/254) by @the-orex), which is otherwise superseded by the 0.7.0 dependency bumps.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- **Breaking** for code that matches on `PrefilterError` or builds a prefilter with a struct literal. `PrefilterError` gained variants for the account-filter and data-slice checks, and `AccountPrefilter`, `TransactionPrefilter` and `SlotPrefilter` each gained fields. Neither type is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so an exhaustive `match` on the error and any `AccountPrefilter { accounts, owners }` literal stop compiling; add a wildcard arm and `..Default::default()` respectively. Builder users are unaffected ([#303](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/issues/303)).
- Bumped `yellowstone-grpc-proto` from `12.4` to `12.6`, picking up the Transaction V1 (SIMD-0385) `Message.config` field and the `cuckoo_account_include` transaction filter. The new filter is not exposed through `TransactionFilter` and is always sent as `None` ([#304](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/304) by @ultrasilicon).
- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: a parser registered on the `block` pipeline whose prefilter sets `block_meta` or `slot` but none of `include_transactions` / `include_accounts` / `include_entries` no longer receives a `Block` update. Previously any `block_meta`/`slot` prefilter forced its filter ID into the block match list, so such a parser received a header-only `Block`: `transactions` and `accounts` were always empty. Use a `block_meta` pipeline instead.

### Deprecated

- `shipstern-proc-macro`: the `cpi_event_discriminator` and `cpi_event_payload_offset` macro arguments are ignored, with a deprecation warning at the call site, when the IDL declares a CPI event envelope. They still apply to IDLs that declare none. Both arguments are removed in 0.10 ([#299](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/299) by @senzenn).

### Added

- The Yellowstone gRPC source replaces the live subscription mid-stream, so a changing filter set no longer costs a reconnect. `Runtime::handle` hands out a cheap `Clone` `RuntimeHandle` before `run` consumes the runtime; `filters` reports the last set handed to the source, `update_filters` patches it under a lock, `send_filter_update` replaces it wholesale, and `reset_filters` restores the registered set. The handle exists only for sources implementing `FilterUpdateSource`, which today is gRPC alone, so taking one from any other source is a compile error rather than a runtime one. Keys are parser IDs, except for instruction parsers, which the runtime bundles behind a single `InstructionPipeline::ID` entry. A set naming a parser with no registered pipeline is refused with `FilterUpdateError::UnknownParser` before anything is sent, and `Ok(())` means the set reached the source rather than that the server applied it ([#302](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/302) by @senzenn, [#305](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/305) and [#307](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/307) by @kespinola).
- `Filters` gained `get`, `parser_ids`, `insert`, `merge`, and `remove`, keyed by parser ID, so the next subscription can be built without reaching into the map by hand ([#305](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/305) by @kespinola).
- `Prefilter` can express the rest of Yellowstone's subscription surface, which `impl From<Filters> for SubscribeRequest` previously hardcoded to empty. `AccountPrefilter` gained `filters` (memcmp, data size, token-account state, and lamport comparisons, via the new `AccountFilter`, `MemcmpData` and `LamportsCmp` types) and `nonempty_txn_signature`; `TransactionPrefilter` gained `accounts_exclude`, `vote` and `signature`; `SlotPrefilter` gained `interslot_updates`; and the Yellowstone gRPC source config gained `accounts-data-slice`, which is request-level rather than per-parser. Builder setters check account filters against the rules the server enforces when it builds its own filter (memcmp encoding and size, filter count, at most one data size, no `token-account-state = false`), so a bad config fails at build time instead of taking the subscription down when it is opened; `YellowstoneGrpcConfig::validate` checks the data-slice windows for order and overlap, and the source calls it before it dials. Every field defaults to the previous behaviour. `transactions_status` and `entry` stay unsupported: they are separate subscription kinds with no pipeline behind them, so nothing could consume what they delivered ([#303](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/issues/303)).
- `shipstern-core`: `InstructionShared` gained `transaction_config: Option<TransactionConfig>`, the inline compute budget that Transaction V1 (SIMD-0385) carries on the message instead of in top-level `ComputeBudget` instructions. It exposes the priority fee, compute-unit limit, loaded-accounts data-size limit, and heap size. It is `None` for Legacy and V0 transactions and for jetstream-source transactions, which are decoded from an SDK without a V1 message variant ([#304](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/304) by @ultrasilicon).
- `shipstern-proc-macro`: generated account types and the `Instructions` wrapper now expose `DISCRIMINATOR` and `DISCRIMINATOR_OFFSET` constants, so consumers can build `memcmp` filters and route on discriminators without re-deriving the bytes from the IDL. The pair is a memcmp predicate: the bytes the parser compares at that offset. It is not a payload boundary, because numeric discriminators (for example SPL Governance) are re-read as the first field of the account body, so decoding still goes through `try_unpack`. No constant is emitted where the parser could not honor it: size-only discriminators, zero-length discriminators, fixed-size fields whose declared width disagrees with the decoded default bytes, and instruction names that collide after case folding ([#294](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-vixen/issues/294)).
- `shipstern-proc-macro`: the CPI event envelope is read from the IDL. An IDL that declares the self-CPI envelope on `eventNode.discriminators`, the form Carbon and `@codama/renderers-vixen-parser` emit, previously failed to build with an event discriminator collision, because every event was keyed on the first discriminator in its chain, which for an enveloped IDL is the shared envelope tag. `EVENT_PAYLOAD_OFFSET` had the mirror problem: it came from the macro arguments and defaulted to 8, so the CPI path always stripped a fixed byte count and only happened to be right for a standard Anchor tag. The macro now infers the envelope from the chain (a constant at offset 0 is the tag, the next discriminator's declared offset is the payload offset), checks that every declaring event agrees on both, rebases the remaining discriminators so the CPI and log paths share one layout, and ANDs a chain of two or more. Padded layouts round-trip because the payload offset is the declared offset rather than the tag length. Chains that cannot be honored fail the build instead of parsing arbitrarily: two constants at offset 0, overlapping ranges, a mix of constant and non-constant nodes behind a tag, an event whose only discriminator is the tag, or discriminator bytes that do not decode, which previously panicked the macro. A build-time guard also rejects an envelope tag that prefixes an instruction discriminator at offset 0 in either direction, because the parser filters any instruction whose data starts with the tag before dispatch; it checks the tag actually in use, whether from the IDL, the macro arguments, or the Anchor default. Instruction parsing is untouched ([#299](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/299) by @senzenn).

### Fixed

- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: emit `SubscribeUpdateBlockMeta` and `SubscribeUpdateSlot` for filters that request them. `block_meta` and `slot` prefilters were previously bucketed into the block match list, so their filter IDs rode on `UpdateOneof::Block`. The runtime dispatches by variant, so those IDs matched no pipeline and were dropped with only a `trace!` line: block-meta and slot parsers ran to completion having handled zero updates, and `shipstern-block-coordinator`, which keys on `BlockMeta`, received none of it on the historical-replay path (delivering it is a prerequisite for driving that crate from replay, not on its own sufficient). Both messages are built from fields already carried on `BlockData::Block`. Replayed slots report `SLOT_FINALIZED`, since Old Faithful archives hold only finalized history and cannot reproduce the processed/confirmed transitions that `SlotPrefilter::filter_by_commitment = false` asks for.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- **Breaking**: the project is renamed from Yellowstone Vixen to Shipstern and the repository moved to `solana-rpc/shipstern`. Every crate is renamed with the `yellowstone-vixen` prefix replaced by `shipstern` (`yellowstone-vixen` → `shipstern`, `yellowstone-vixen-core` → `shipstern-core`, `yellowstone-vixen-yellowstone-grpc-source` → `shipstern-yellowstone-grpc-source`, and so on), so dependents must update their `Cargo.toml` and `use` paths. The protobuf wire packages move with it: `vixen.stream` → `shipstern.stream` and `vixen.parser.{token,bpf_loader,token_extensions}` → `shipstern.parser.{token,bpf_loader,token_extensions}`. That is the wire contract, not internal naming. The gRPC method path becomes `/shipstern.stream.ProgramStreams/Subscribe`, so clients generated from the old schemas fail with `UNIMPLEMENTED`, and the `google.protobuf.Any` type URLs in `SubscribeUpdate.parsed` become `type.googleapis.com/shipstern.parser.token.TokenAccount` and friends, so old type-URL matches stop matching without erroring. Consumers must regenerate from the new schemas. Wire-compatibility tests now pin the four package declarations and the service path, and fail on any leftover `vixen.*` declaration. Historical changelog links keep the `rpcpool/yellowstone-vixen` URL, which GitHub redirects ([#279](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/279) by @kespinola).
- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: bumped `jetstreamer-firehose` and `jetstreamer-utils` from `0.5` to `0.7`. **Breaking** for struct-literal construction: `JetstreamSourceConfig` gained `reverse: bool` (default `false`, `#[serde(default)]`, clap `--reverse` in the example), which replays slots newest-first. `reverse` implies `sequential` upstream, so it also gets the bounded ripget window described under Fixed. Setting `buffer_window_bytes` with neither `sequential` nor `reverse` enabled now logs a warning, since upstream ignores the value in that mode ([#285](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/285) by @senzenn).

### Fixed

- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: sequential replays could hang without emitting a slot. Upstream's default ripget window, the smaller of 4 GiB and 15% of RAM, can exceed what its own 180-second header-read timeout allows to download, so it retried forever. When `buffer_window_bytes` is unset and `sequential` (or `reverse`) is on, the source now passes `DEFAULT_SEQUENTIAL_BUFFER_WINDOW_BYTES` (256 MiB) and logs that it did; an explicit `buffer_window_bytes` still wins ([#284](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/284) by @senzenn).
- `shipstern-kafka-sink` (`experimental-account-parser`): an account update is now handed only to the account parser whose program ID matches the account's owner. Previously every registered account parser was tried in turn, so an account owned by an unrelated program could be counted as a parse error and routed to another parser's fallback topic ([#283](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/283) by @the-orex).
- `shipstern` runtime config: a `[buffer]` section that set `jobs` but omitted `sources-channel-size` failed to deserialize and killed the process before it connected. The `Default` impl already used `100`, but serde never consults it for a missing field. The field now carries a serde default and a clap `default_value_t`, both `100`, matching how `auto-reconnect` already behaves in the gRPC source ([#282](https://github.com/solana-rpc/shipstern/pull/282) by @senzenn).
- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: populate `Reward::commission_bps` on both reward conversion paths. The field arrived with `yellowstone-grpc-proto` 12.5 and was hardcoded to an empty string, so consumers reading it saw nothing even though `commission` was already forwarded. It is now derived from the whole-percent commission, which is lossless because the source is a `u8` percentage: a 7% commission reports `700`. Salvaged from ([#254](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-vixen/pull/254) by @the-orex), which is otherwise superseded by the 0.7.0 dependency bumps.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-26

### Changed

- `shipstern` runtime buffer: replaced the topograph executor with a native crossbeam-channel worker pool. Behavioral change: peak outstanding work is now `jobs` total (queued + in-flight); topograph capped running handlers at `jobs` but left the queue behind them unbounded. `jobs` bounds concurrency, so raising it only helps when the handlers are the bottleneck; with cheap handlers the producer is the limit and a higher `jobs` yields no gain. Public `Buffer` API unchanged. On shutdown the buffer waits for handlers that already started, bounded to 30 seconds, so a signal-initiated stop (SIGINT/SIGTERM) no longer cancels them part-way through; a stop additionally discards work still queued behind them, while a clean close runs the queue too. A handler that never returns is logged and abandoned rather than blocking shutdown indefinitely.
- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: bumped `jetstreamer-firehose` and `jetstreamer-utils` from `0.2` to `0.5` to track upstream Anza releases.
- **Breaking** for downstream struct-literal construction: `JetstreamSourceConfig` gained two new fields, `sequential: bool` (default `false`) and `buffer_window_bytes: Option<u64>` (default `None`), to expose the upstream `sequential` / ripget buffer-window controls. Both are `#[serde(default)]` and have clap defaults, so deserialized and CLI-built configs are unaffected; only direct struct-literal initialization needs updating.
- Bumped `yellowstone-grpc-client` from `12` to `13.1` and `yellowstone-grpc-proto` from `12` to `12.4`, picking up the client's built-in auto-reconnect support introduced in v13.1.
- Auto-reconnect on the Yellowstone gRPC source is now **on by default**. It is configured via three new `YellowstoneGrpcConfig` fields: `auto-reconnect` (bool, default `true`), `reconnect-max-retries`, and `reconnect-slot-retention`. When enabled the source uses a sturdy default backoff (10 retries, 500 ms base, 2.0× multiplier — covers outages up to ~4 minutes) instead of the client library's weaker default. Set `auto-reconnect = false` to opt out. Existing config files keep deserializing (`#[serde(default)]`), but downstream struct-literal construction of `YellowstoneGrpcConfig` must initialize the new fields. Requires the server to have `replay_stored_slots` configured for gap-free recovery.

### Added

- `SubscribeRequest` filter structs gained `cuckoo_accounts_filter` (`SubscribeRequestFilterAccounts`), `token_accounts` (`SubscribeRequestFilterTransactions`), and `cuckoo_account_include` (`SubscribeRequestFilterBlocks`) from `yellowstone-grpc-proto` 12.5. All are defaulted to `None`, preserving prior behavior.
- `Reward` gained `commission_bps` (string) from `yellowstone-grpc-proto` 12.5; defaulted to an empty string on the jetstream source's reward conversion paths.

### Fixed

- `shipstern-jetstream-source`: forward per-account block rewards in emitted `SubscribeUpdateBlock`. Previously `rewards.rewards` was hardcoded to `vec![]`, dropping fee/rent/staking/voting rewards on the historical-replay path even though `num_partitions` was forwarded. Adds `convert::keyed_rewards` performing the canonical `KeyedRewardsAndNumPartitions` → `proto::Rewards` mapping (matches `solana-storage-proto`'s `From<Reward>` encoding).
