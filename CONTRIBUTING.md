## Getting Started

To contribute to this project, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. This project builds successfully with the latest **stable** Rust, and also with the latest **nightly**. We also use a workspace structure with multiple crates.

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-vixen.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Install Rust and Set the Toolchain**

   If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

3. **Build the Project**

   Ensure that you can build the project successfully.

   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**

   Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for the branch.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**

   Make your changes in the appropriate crate(s) within the `crates` directory. Use the `crates/test` crate to try out and verify your changes.

3. **Format Your Code**

   Ensure that your code is properly formatted. We use `rustfmt` with nightly toolchain for formatting.

   ```sh
   cargo +nightly fmt --all
   ```

4. **Run Clippy**

   Run Clippy to catch common mistakes and ensure code quality.

   ```sh
   cargo clippy --all-targets --tests -- -Dwarnings
   ```

## Running Tests
